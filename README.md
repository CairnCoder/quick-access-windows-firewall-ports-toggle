A small script to toggle on/off a network port used for SMB1. I was aware of the security flaws in SMB1 but in certain curcumstances sill had to use it. Hence I wanted a quick way to turn close the secutiry hole (i think it worked, it was a few years ago).

Now redundant, but worth showing my level of investigation.
